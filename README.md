## Welcome to syncTube !
## Inspiration üí°
me and my cousins(my teammates) were trying to watch some videos on youtube to learn about a framework initially but discord was a bit laggy and the other participants were not able to see the video clearly and than I though about creating this webApp where anyone can watch any video on sync with their friends, students, family and can chat as well on the same time
## What it does ‚öôÔ∏è
syncTube helps the users to watch youtube videos on sync with other participants which will help in reducing the usage of internet and will be helping the environment as well in a small manner, and with that the users can even use the chat feature while studying or watching videos which is really necessary in today's world
## How we built it ‚öíÔ∏è
We used ejs, css, javascript, nodejs, expressjs and socket.io  to create this webApp, since youtube doesn't allow us to edit the functions of the controls so I removed them and created another below it and than synced it with the timeline, after that for the chat application I again used socket.io and to see who's messaging there we have added a prompt that will ask the name first and than display it to other users.
## Challenges we ran into ‚ùå
Except one all the other teammates were beginner so we had to learn a lot.
The main issue that we faced was to host the site on netlify, we tried multiple ways but were not able to do so. 
making the player move as per the timeline was really difficult, it took a lot of time to understand everything about the API through the documentations but at the end it  worked
## Accomplishments that we're proud of üòä
We are really proud that we were able to make this imagination of ours worked, using socket.io instead of longpolling was a big tough decision since we didn't had experience with it but still we were able to pull if off.
Making this webApp work in this short period of time was really difficult that even we had to stay awake the entire night to make it possible so we are really proud about how it worked out in the end.
## What we learned üë®‚Äçüî¨
(Aryan) ,(Krishna) for some participants it was their first experience with programming but still they were able to learn the basics and contributed towards the frontend.
(Satyam)I was able to learn socket.io and even learned a lot about networking, I learned a lot about how servers and webApp works in general.
## What's next for syncTube ‚è≠Ô∏è
We are gonna turn this webApp into a edTech company by adding some features like to, do list where students can paste the video links of other videos so that once the ongoing is ended it will dynamically change the url to the one in the list, we will be integrating Notion in our webApp which is a great tool to take notes, with that we will add twilio API to send the msg to our friends to join us there, and I am sure a lot more can be achieved with this.


##How to run it:
