## What it does ?
It helps users to watch YouTube videos on <b>sync</b> with their friends and interact with them on the same time.

## How to use it?
On the index page you have the option to either Join a room (if there is any) or create one by just submitting a name for the room.
After that in the room page you will first have to enter your name in the prompt which will be used for the chat feature and than you and your friends both can use the controllers on the same time and if one user seeks to a certain timestap than others will get redirected to it automatically with the help of <b>websockets</b>.
